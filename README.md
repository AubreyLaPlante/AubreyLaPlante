- 👋 Hi, I’m @AubreyLaPlante
- 👀 I’m interested in studying earthquakes, tsunamis and natural hazard mitigation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to detrend DEMs via Fast Fourier Transforms and Fast Wavelet Transforms, to remove noise and map seafloor faulting in the Japan Trench.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on dynamic rupture modeling.
- 📫 You can see more of my research and personal contact information on my personal website, aubreylaplante.weebly.com .
